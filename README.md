# Devreplay

Devreplay is static analysis tool based on your own proguramming style.

## How to use

1. Install on local

```sh
sudo npm install devreplay
```

2. Create your own programming style(`devreplay.json`) on the root like bellow
```json
[
    {
       "code": [
            "- console .",
            "* log --> info",
            "* \"Hello\" --> \"Hello World!\"",
            "= )",
            "+ ;"
       ]
    }
]
```
This mean if your code has `console.log`, it should be `info`
Please careful when you use `-` symbol or `*` symbol, you should add space by tokens (e.g. `- console.` should be `- console .`).

And create your code(`hello.ts`) like this.
```ts
console.log("Hello")
```

3. 
Run to get warning
```sh
devreplay hello.ts devreplay.json
hello.ts:1: console.log"Hello") should be info"HelloWorld!");
```
or get correct code
```sh
devreplay --fix hello.ts devreplay.json > hello2.ts
```
you can get `hello2.ts`, like bellow

```ts
info("Hello World!");
```
