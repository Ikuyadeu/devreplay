# Devreplay

Devreplay is static analysis tool based on your own proguramming pattern.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.devreplay)
* [Other Editors (Language Server)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devreplay-server)
* [GitHub Application](https://github.com/marketplace/dev-replay)
* [Auto pattern generator](https://github.com/devreplay/review_pattern_gen)

## How to use

1. Install on local

```sh
sudo npm install devreplay
```

2. Create your own programming pattern(`devreplay.json`) on the root like bellow
(**Recommend**) [Review Pattern Generator](https://github.com/Ikuyadeu/review_pattern_gen) can generate your rule file automatically
```json
[
    {
        "condition": [
            "tmp = $1",
            "$1 = $2",
            "$2 = tmp"
        ],
        "consequent": [
            "$1, $2 = $2, $1"
        ]
    },
]
```

If you write the following code,
```python
tmp = a
a = b
b = a
```
it will be
```python
a, b = b, a
```

3. **Step up**: Make the pattern description and severity. Also condition can be more abstract

```json
[
    {
        "condition": [
            "$3 = $1",
            "$1 = $2",
            "$2 = $3"
        ],
        "consequent": [
            "$1, $2 = $2, $1"
        ],
        "description": "Value exchanging can be one line",
        "severity": "Information"
    },
]
```


`Severity` means how this pattern is important
* `E`: **E**rror
* `W`: **W**arning
* `I`: **I**nformation
* `H`: **H**int

3. Run to get warning
```sh
devreplay hello.py devreplay.json
test/files/hello.ts:4:
for $0 in xrange($1.$2): should be import six       for $0 in six.moves.range($1.$2):
```
or get correct code
```sh
devreplay --fix hello.py devreplay.json > hello2.py
```
you can get `hello2.py`, like bellow

```python
import six
for a in six.moves.range(array.x):
    pass
```
