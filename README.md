# Devreplay

Devreplay is static analysis tool based on your own proguramming pattern.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.devreplay)
* [Other Editor Support (Language Server)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devreplay-server)
* [GitHub Application](https://github.com/marketplace/dev-replay)
* [Pattern generator](https://github.com/devreplay/devreplay-pattern-generator)

## How to use

1. Install on local

```sh
npm install devreplay
# or
yarn global add 
```

2. Put your own programming pattern(`devreplay.json`) on the project like bellow
```json
[
    {
        "condition": [
            "tmp = $1",
            "$1 = $2",
            "$2 = tmp"
        ],
        "consequent": [
            "$1, $2 = $2, $1"
        ]
    }
]
```

If you write the following code,
```python
tmp = a
a = b
b = a
```
it will be
```python
a, b = b, a
```


* **Recommend**: [DevReplay Pattern Generator](https://github.com/devreplay/devreplay-pattern-generator) generate your pattern from .git
* **Step up**: Make the pattern description and severity. Also condition can be more abstract

```json
[
    {
        "condition": [
            "$3 = $1",
            "$1 = $2",
            "$2 = $3"
        ],
        "consequent": [
            "$1, $2 = $2, $1"
        ],
        "description": "Value exchanging can be one line",
        "severity": "Information"
    },
]
```


`Severity` means how this pattern is important
* `E`: **E**rror
* `W`: **W**arning
* `I`: **I**nformation
* `H`: **H**int

3. Run to get warning
```sh
$ devreplay hello.py devreplay.json
I:test/files/test.py:15:Value exchanging can be one line
```

or get correct code

```sh
devreplay --fix hello.py devreplay.json > hello.py
```
you can get fixed `hello.py`
