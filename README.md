# Devreplay

Devreplay is static analysis tool based on your own proguramming pattern.
* Visual Studio Code for DevReplay is [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.devreplay)
* GitHub Application for DevReplay is [here](https://github.com/marketplace/dev-replay)
* Auto pattern generator is [here](https://github.com/Ikuyadeu/review_pattern_gen)

## How to use

1. Install on local

```sh
sudo npm install devreplay
```

2. Create your own programming pattern(`devreplay.json`) on the root like bellow
(**Recommend**) [Review Pattern Generator](https://github.com/Ikuyadeu/review_pattern_gen) can generate your rule file automatically
```json
[
    {
        "condition": [
            "for $0 in xrange(${1:name}.$2):"
        ],
        "consequent": [
            "import six",
            "for $0 in six.moves.range(${1:name}.$2):"
        ],
        "description": "You shoud use six for python 3",
        "severity": "E"
    },
]
```
This mean if your code has `xrange`, it should be `six.moves.range`

And create your code(`hello.py`) like this.
```python
for a in xrange(array.x):
    pass
```

`Severity` means how this pattern is important
* `E`: **E**rror
* `W`: **W**arning
* `I`: **I**nformation
* `H`: **H**int

3. Run to get warning
```sh
devreplay hello.py devreplay.json
test/files/hello.ts:4:
for $0 in xrange($1.$2): should be import six       for $0 in six.moves.range($1.$2):
```
or get correct code
```sh
devreplay --fix hello.py devreplay.json > hello2.py
```
you can get `hello2.py`, like bellow

```python
import six
for a in six.moves.range(array.x):
    pass
```
